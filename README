I wrote this compiler over the course of 10 weeks in Mackey's Compiler design 
class at UCSC and recieved a grade of A+.  That being said you still may find 
a bug or two in this compiler.  I am fixing these as I find them.  


Simple C-Like Compiler

This program defines a compiler for a simple C like language OC, written 
by Dr. Wesley Mackey at UCSC. 

USAGE:

input: oc program.oc
outputs: 

    Executable binary:  program

    Five intermediate files involed in compilation (can be ignored)
        program.str
        program.tok
        program.ast
        program.sym
        program.oil


OC LANGUAGE:

syntax:  OC follows C-like syntax, for examples see .oc files included in directory.

Note that the line '#include "oclib.oh"' should be 
included in every oc program to use the built in library.

    void __assert_fail (string expr, string file, int line);
    void putb (bool b);
    void putc (char c);
    void puti (int i);
    void puts (string s);
    void endl ();
    int getc ();
    string getw ();
    string getln ();
    string[] getargv ();
    void exit (int status);
