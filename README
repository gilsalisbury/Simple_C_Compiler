Assignmnet 5:

This assignment generates oil code.

Oil code compiles and runs for some programs, but fails due
to some pointer assignments and some cases of nested if elses
among others...

This program should take any .oc file as input and output 
five files:

program.str
program.tok
program.ast
program.sym
program.oil
